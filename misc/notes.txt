# C# Basic Syntax #

ARRAYS - uses .Length
Declared and with unknown size
	float[] numbers;

Have to declare size because we are initalizing the array.
	float[] numbers = new float[5]; 

We can also init it with data by using the brackets. *important* We do not need to declare the size if we init it with data.
	float[] numbers = new numbers[2] {5.3, 2.2};

LOOPING ARRAYS & LISTS WITH FOREACH
Use explicit type when using foreach i.e float, string.
	foreach(float number in numbers)
	{
		result += number;
	}

LISTS - uses .Count
Lists requires you to use a type argument when declaring it,
i.e float, double, or a custom type.
	List<float> grades = new List<float>();
