###### C# Basic Syntax ######

###### ARRAYS - uses .Length ######
Declared and with unknown size
	float[] numbers;

Have to declare size because we are initalizing the array.
	float[] numbers = new float[5]; 

We can also init it with data by using the brackets. *important* We do not need to declare the size if we init it with data.
	float[] numbers = new numbers[2] {5.3, 2.2};

###### LISTS - uses .Count ######
Lists requires you to use a type argument when declaring it,
i.e float, double, or a custom type.
	List<float> grades = new List<float>();

###### LOOPING ARRAYS & LISTS WITH FOREACH ######
Use explicit type when using foreach e.g float, string.
	foreach(float number in numbers)
	{
		result += number;
	}

###### STRINGS ######
Use $ infront to format text and variables.
More options below for different string formats.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-numeric-format-strings
	WriteLine($"Hello {name}");
Display the PI number with 3 digits.
	WriteLine($"PI is {PI:N3}");

*** string excersise ***
a. user input any number and converts decimal numbers to hexadecimal and print it out in the terminal window.
b. convert any character (0-9, a-z, A-Z) to hexadecimal
   by using the information from the ascii table.
c. convert decimal and/or hexadecimal to binary number.

##### CLASSES #####
Remember to use namespaces to avoid global namespaces.
Usally the same name as the program and/or class.
Think about what the behaviour(s) of the class is e.g.
	book.AddGrade(74.1);
	book.ChangeGrade(x, 64.3);
	book.Count; << return the total of all current grades in the book in decimal number.
Procede to code the method after that.

Field definitions
When declaring fields they can not use the "var" keyword.
	List<float> grades = new List<float>();
	float numberOfBooks;

Constructor
With a explicit constructor. Have to have the same name as the class.
Now we can declare a list in the field and initsilize it in the constructor for each object.
	List<float> grades;
	public Book()
	{
		grades = new List<float>();
	}

We can also add required parameters for our constructor of the object.
	public Book()
	{
		
	}
