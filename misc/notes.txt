ARRAYS
Declared and with unknown size
	float[] numbers;

Have to declare size because we are initalizing the array.
	float[] numbers = new float[5]; 

We can also init it with data by using the brackets. *important* We do not need to declare the size if we init it with data.
	float[] numbers = new numbers[2] {5.3, 2.2};
